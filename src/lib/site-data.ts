    body: "AI tools have made secondary research faster and cheaper than ever. Yet the most important questions — what your patients feel, what voters fear, what chemists actually stock — can only be answered by going to the source.\n\nAt UMP, we combine the speed of digital with the depth of fieldwork. Our enumerators are trained, our questionnaires are piloted, and our analysis is sharp. The result: insights you can defend in a board room and act on the next morning.\n\nPrimary research is not nostalgia. It is the only way to build a moat of proprietary evidence in a market where everyone has access to the same models.",

They respond to credibility, accessibility and outcomes.\n\nThe modern playbook blends three things: hyperlocal awareness (camps, school programs, RWAs), credible content (doctor-led explainers), and experience (a smooth first visit). UMP helps hospitals orchestrate this across catchments with research-backed targeting.",
